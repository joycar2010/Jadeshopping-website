# Backend Management System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

A comprehensive backend management system for the jade shopping e-commerce platform, providing secure administrative control over system operations, user management, and operator account administration. The system enables administrators to manage frontend users, configure system settings, and maintain operational security through role-based access control.

The system addresses the need for centralized administration of the e-commerce platform, ensuring data consistency between frontend and backend operations while maintaining secure authentication protocols for administrative access.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles

| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Super Admin | System initialization with default credentials | Full system access, operator management, system configuration |
| System Admin | Created by Super Admin | User management, content management, order processing |
| Operator | Created by Admin users | Limited access to assigned modules |

### 2.2 Feature Module

Our backend management system consists of the following main pages:

1. **Admin Login Page**: Secure authentication portal with credential validation
2. **Dashboard Page**: System overview, statistics, and quick access navigation
3. **System Settings Page**: Operator account management, system configuration
4. **User Management Page**: Frontend user administration, data synchronization
5. **Admin Profile Page**: Administrator account settings and preferences

### 2.3 Page Details

| Page Name | Module Name | Feature description |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Admin Login Page | Authentication System | Secure login with username/password validation, session management, remember me functionality |
| Dashboard Page | System Overview | Display system statistics, recent activities, quick navigation to key modules |
| System Settings Page | Operator Account Management | Create, edit, delete operator accounts; manage permissions and roles; default admin account setup |
| User Management Page | Frontend User Administration | View, edit, delete frontend users; remove mock data; ensure data consistency with frontend |
| User Management Page | Data Synchronization | Real-time sync between frontend user data and backend management system |
| Admin Profile Page | Account Management | Update admin profile, change password, manage personal settings |

## 3. Core Process

### Admin Authentication Flow
1. Admin accesses `/admin` route
2. System redirects to `/admin/login` if not authenticated
3. Admin enters credentials (default: admin/123456)
4. System validates credentials and creates secure session
5. Admin is redirected to dashboard upon successful authentication

### User Management Flow
1. Admin navigates to User Management section
2. System displays all frontend users (no mock data)
3. Admin can view, edit, or delete user accounts
4. Changes are synchronized with frontend user data in real-time
5. System maintains data consistency across all platforms

### Operator Account Management Flow
1. Super Admin accesses System Settings
2. Admin creates new operator accounts with specific roles
3. System assigns appropriate permissions based on role
4. New operators can login with assigned credentials
5. Admin can modify or deactivate operator accounts as needed
